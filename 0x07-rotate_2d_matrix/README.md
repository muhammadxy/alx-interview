## Mandatory Tasks

### :white_check_mark: 0. Rotate 2D Matrix
Given an n x n 2D matrix, rotate it 90 degrees clockwise.

* Prototype: `def rotate_2d_matrix(matrix):`
* Do not return anything. The matrix must be edited **in-place**.
* You can assume the matrix will have 2 dimensions and will not be empty.
