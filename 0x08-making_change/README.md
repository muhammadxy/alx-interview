## Mandatory Tasks

### :white_check_mark: 0. Change comes from within
Given a pile of coins of different values, determine the fewest number of coins needed to meet a given amount total.

* Prototype: `def makeChange(coins, total)`
* Return: fewest number of coins needed to meet total
    * If total is 0 or less, return 0
    * If total cannot be met by any number of coins you have, return -1
* coins is a list of the values of the coins in your possession
* The value of a coin will always be an integer greater than 0
* You can assume you have an infinite number of each denomination of coin in the list
* Your solutionâ€™s runtime will be evaluated in this task
