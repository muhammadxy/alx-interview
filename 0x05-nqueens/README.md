## Mandatory Tasks

### :white_check_mark: 0. N queens
The N queens puzzle is the challenge of placing N non-attacking queens on an N×N chessboard. Write a program that solves the N queens problem.

* Usage: `nqueens N`
    * If the user called the program with the wrong number of arguments, print `Usage: nqueens N`, followed by a new line, and exit with the status 1
* where N must be an integer greater or equal to 4
    * If N is not an integer, print `N must be a number`, followed by a new line, and exit with the status 1
    * If N is smaller than 4, print `N must be at least 4`, followed by a new line, and exit with the status 1
* The program should print every possible solution to the problem
    * One solution per line
    * Format: see example
    * You don’t have to print the solutions in a specific order
* You are only allowed to import the `sys` module
