    * 1 represents land
    * Each cell is square, with a side length of 1
    * Cells are connected horizontally/vertically (not diagonally).
    * grid is rectangular, with its width and height not exceeding 100
* The grid is completely surrounded by water
* There is only one island (or nothing).
* The island doesn’t have “lakes” (water inside that isn’t connected to the water surrounding the island).
